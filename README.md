# NM-bionic-hand
Here is where I'm putting all the current files for the Nilheim Mechatronics Biomimetic Mechatronic Hand project. The development process of this project will be documented on the Will Cogley YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUD_8b1JoTL2ipOVtxfNKw/featured. 

## 2018 Report
This PDF contains most of the research and documentation of my original design. Some of the information is outdated and there are formatting issues, but this may be a good place to start if you want to familiarise yourself with the journey so far. 

## FDM Prototypes
The FDM files are early prototypes designed for printing on FDM machines. It is expected that the majority of parts will be manufactured using SLA printing, so these files are only really intended as reference.
